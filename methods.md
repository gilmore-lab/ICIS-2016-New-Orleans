# Methodological details

## Camera

We used a wearable camera that was lightweight, cable-free, attached to daily-wear hats, and easy for parents to use. The head camera was the commercially available Looxcie 2 <www.looxcie.com/products>. The camera has three critical properties relevant to this study: a very lightweight 22g body, built-in recording capacity, and a rechargeable non-heating battery. The camera measures 0.91” x 0.67” x 3.33”, has an f2.8 lens with a 75o diagonal FOV (41o vertical FOV, 69o horizontal FOV), and a 2” to infinity depth of focus. Each camera has a recording capacity of 3-4 hours of video at the rate of 30 frames per second. The camera was attached to a snug fitting hat as shown in Figure 1a. Parents were given two hat-camera systems.

## Parent instructions

In a pre-visit, parents were informed about the goal of the study, consent was obtained, and they were instructed to use the camera. A hat was selected and fit to the child. Subsequently, the materials were delivered to the infant’s home and the parents were reinstructed in the use of the camera. Parents were not told that we were interested in faces or social events but were told that we were interested in visual development and the typical range of visual experiences of their infant. They were asked to record during the infants’ waking hours and to try to capture four to six hours of video during daily activities when the infant was awake and alert. Because of the complexity and demands of parenting young infants, they were given up to two weeks to complete their recording. The cameras were collected once parents had completed their recording; parents were debriefed and consistent with the consent procedure were asked if they wanted any segments deleted.
