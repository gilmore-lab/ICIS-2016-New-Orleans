	abstract = {Human infants undergo significant changes in body size, posture, and locomotor capability over the first several years of life. As a result, the statistics of visual motion infant observers experience differs from adults in some situations [1,2]. We ask whether these differences apply more generally, and if so, what factors account for them. In one analysis, we simulate the effects of changes in body posture, speed of locomotion, and surface geometry on motion statistics. In a second analysis, we empirically measure the statistics of visual motion experienced by observers across the first year of life using infant-perspective videos captured during episodes when infants were moving through space or were stationary. We include samples of infants in from North America and those from India to assess how variations in cultural practices influence infants' visual experiences. We find that fast laminar motion patterns dominate the visual input young infants experience and that cultural differences play a role in shaping visual motion experiences.},

Skewed normal distributions fitted to estimated retinal speeds peak at values above 20/sec.},

	abstract = {How does visual experience change over development? To investigate changes in visual input over the developmental transition from crawling to walking, thirty 13-month-olds crawled or walked down a straight path wearing a head-mounted eye tracker that recorded gaze direction and head-centered field of view. Thirteen additional infants wore a motion tracker that recorded head orientation. Compared to walkers, crawlers' field of view contained less walls and more floor. Walkers directed gaze straight ahead at caregivers, whereas crawlers looked down at the floor. Crawlers obtained visual information about targets at higher elevations—caregivers and toys—by craning their heads upward and sitting up to bring the room into view. Findings indicate that visual experiences are intimately tied to infants' posture.},
